# Website-clone-cutmyplastic
##Clone of the home page from a website called cutmyplastic. JavaScript, HTML and CSS

The original website (cut my plastic) is a bootstrap website. Ive made a copy of the website using HTML5, CSS3 and JAVASCRIPT. Ive used font awsome for the image icons and swiper js for the drag carousel slider. vanilla js for the modal slider and navagation modal functionality.

 All code was written from scratch and passes validation (no errors). Check out the original website at https://www.cutmyplastic.co.uk/ and compare it to my replication.
